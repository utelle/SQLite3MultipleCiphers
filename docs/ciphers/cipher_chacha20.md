## sqleet: ChaCha20-Poly1305

This cipher was introduced for SQLite database encryption by the project [sqleet](https://github.com/resilar/sqleet) in 2017.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) officially standardized the cipher algorithm **_ChaCha20_** and the message authentication code **_Poly1305_** in [RFC 7905](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7905) for Transport Layer Security (TLS).

For [wxSQLite3](https://github.com/utelle/wxsqlite3) this cipher was the default since version 4.0.0, and continues to be the default for **SQLite3 Multiple Ciphers**, too.

The encryption key is derived from the passphrase using a random salt (stored in the first 16 bytes of the database file) and the standardized PBKDF2 algorithm with an SHA256 hash function.

One-time keys per database page are derived from the encryption key, the page number, and a 16 bytes nonce. Additionally, a 16 bytes **_Poly1305_** authentication tag per database page is calculated. Therefore this cipher requires 32 reserved bytes per database page.

The following table lists all parameters related to this cipher that can be set before activating database encryption.

| Parameter | Default | sqleet | Min | Max | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `kdf_iter` | 64007 | 12345 | 1 | | Number of iterations for the key derivation function |
| `legacy` | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | Boolean flag whether the legacy mode should be used |
| `legacy_page_size` | 4096 | 4096 | 0 | 65536 | Page size to use in legacy mode, 0 = default SQLite page size |
| `plaintext_header_size` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100 | Size of plaintext database header</ br> (see note) |

- It is not recommended to use [_legacy_ mode]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/ciphers/cipher_legacy_mode.md %}) for encrypting new databases. It is supported for compatibility reasons only, so that databases that were encrypted in _legacy_ mode can be accessed.
- Only _page size_ values corresponding to a power of 2 (i.e. 0, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536) are allowed.
- If the _plaintext_header_size_ is > 0, then any value within the min-max range is allowed for _legacy_ mode. In non-legacy mode values between 1 and 23 will be interpreted as 24.
